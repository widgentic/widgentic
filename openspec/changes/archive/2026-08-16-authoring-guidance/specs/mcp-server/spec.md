# mcp-server — the authoring guide tool

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Authoring guide tool
The server SHALL expose a read-only `get_authoring_guide` tool whose result is a structured JSON guide containing everything an external agent needs to draft valid widget and theme JSON for its user: the `CustomWidget` shape (`{ kind, template, descriptor }` with the descriptor's fields), the theme entry shape (`{ name, label?, description?, tokens }`), the template DSL's node forms (text, `bind`, `each`/`empty`, `when`/`else`, elements with attrs including `{ bind }` values) and safety rules (no `on*` attributes, URL scheme allowlist, base64 `data:image/*` on `img src` only, depth and node bounds), the identifier charset and the reserved built-in kinds, the styles rules (`.wg-` selectors, banned constructs), the `dataSchema` subset including its `pattern` bounds, a data-modeling preference (bind only schema-declared properties; `$meta.*` is outside `dataSchema` validation and SHALL be discouraged rather than promoted), the token registry with each token's type and use, the per-principal limits, and a `workflow` section stating that agents draft JSON while users import, validate, and save it in the authenticated designer — registration over MCP does not exist by design. Facts with a live source of truth SHALL be derived from it at call time (reserved kinds from the catalog, limits from the store defaults, tokens from the token registry), never duplicated as prose.

#### Scenario: The guide is discoverable and structured
- **WHEN** an SDK client lists tools and calls `get_authoring_guide`
- **THEN** the tool SHALL appear in the listing with a description telling agents when to use it
- **AND** the result text SHALL parse as JSON containing `widget`, `theme`, `rules`, `limits`, and `workflow` sections

#### Scenario: Derived facts match their sources
- **WHEN** the guide is compared against the live system
- **THEN** its reserved kinds SHALL equal the catalog's built-in kinds, its limits SHALL equal the store's documented defaults, and its token list SHALL equal the token registry's names and types

#### Scenario: A draft built from the guide imports cleanly
- **WHEN** a widget and a theme are constructed following only the guide's shapes and rules
- **THEN** the widget SHALL pass the store's write validation and the designer's import, and the theme SHALL pass theme validation — with no corrections needed

#### Scenario: The guide teaches the write boundary
- **WHEN** the `workflow` section is read
- **THEN** it SHALL state that saving happens in the authenticated designer by the user and that no MCP registration tool exists

#### Scenario: The guide steers away from unvalidated meta binds
- **WHEN** the template rules are read
- **THEN** they SHALL prefer schema-declared properties and mark `$meta.*` as outside `dataSchema` validation, to be avoided or reserved for out-of-band display

#### Scenario: Theme-building tools point at the save path
- **WHEN** `list_theme_tokens` or `list_themes` rules are read
- **THEN** they SHALL tell agents that a theme the user wants to keep is delivered as the importable entry (`{ name, label?, description?, tokens }`) for the designer at widgentic.dev, referencing `get_authoring_guide` — the inline token map styles only one render

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: App template loader
The repository SHALL provide the app template (`ui://widgentic/app.html`): a self-contained document with the widgentic base stylesheet and a minimal inline bridge implementing the MCP Apps iframe protocol — the `ui/initialize` handshake (protocol version `2026-01-26`), the `ui/notifications/initialized` notification, `ping`/`ui/resource-teardown` responders, a `ui/notifications/tool-input` placeholder state, and a `ui/notifications/tool-result` listener that renders `structuredContent` (`css` via style text; the widget mounted natively from `structuredContent.tree` when present — DOM built with `createElement`/`createTextNode`, tag and attribute names held to the serializer's allowlists, `on*` attributes skipped — with subsequent tool-results patching the mounted DOM in place, preserving node identity where shape matches; `html` injected into the root only as the fallback when `tree` is absent), with ResizeObserver-driven `ui/notifications/size-changed` reporting. The template SHALL integrate host context (from the initialize result and `host-context-changed`): theme applied as `data-theme`/`color-scheme`, host style variables set on the document root and flowing into the `--wg-*` tokens with widgentic's light literals as final fallback, and safe-area insets applied as body padding. For registry tokens the host bridge does NOT map, the template SHALL flip to the dark preset's values when the host theme is dark (keyed on the applied `data-theme`), so custom widget styles stay coherent in both modes — host-bridged tokens keep their host-derived values, and an explicit widgentic `theme` SHALL still override in both modes. The template SHALL reference no external resources and declare no CSP domains (strictest sandbox).

#### Scenario: Host context is honored
- **WHEN** the host's initialize result or a `host-context-changed` notification carries theme, style variables, or safe-area insets
- **THEN** the template SHALL apply them
- **AND** an explicit widgentic `theme` in `structuredContent.css` SHALL override host-derived token values

#### Scenario: Error results replace the placeholder
- **WHEN** a `tool-result` notification arrives with `isError` or without `structuredContent`
- **THEN** the template SHALL replace any pending placeholder with the result's error message text
- **AND** SHALL never remain in a stale "Rendering…" state

#### Scenario: Template serves with the Apps mime type
- **WHEN** an SDK client reads `ui://widgentic/app.html`
- **THEN** the contents SHALL have `mimeType: "text/html;profile=mcp-app"`, start with `<!doctype html>`, and contain the `ui/initialize` handshake and `tool-result` listener

#### Scenario: Template is network-isolated
- **WHEN** the template is inspected
- **THEN** it SHALL contain no `http(s)://` references and no imports — the bridge is inline

#### Scenario: Native mount matches the serialized fragment
- **WHEN** a tool-result with a `tree` is mounted by the template's builder
- **THEN** the mounted container SHALL be DOM-equivalent to the render's `html` fragment (identical once both are parsed — serializer escaping differences aside)

#### Scenario: Successive results patch in place
- **WHEN** two tool-results for same-shaped trees arrive in sequence
- **THEN** the second SHALL patch the existing DOM (the root element object is preserved) rather than rebuilding it

#### Scenario: Mounter skips unsafe names
- **WHEN** a (tampered) tree carries an `onclick` attribute or an invalid tag name
- **THEN** the mounted DOM SHALL contain neither

#### Scenario: Unbridged tokens follow the host theme
- **WHEN** the host applies `data-theme="dark"` and a custom widget style reads `var(--wg-surface)` with no render theme set
- **THEN** the value SHALL be the dark preset's `surface`, not the light default
- **AND** host-bridged tokens (`bg`, `fg`, `accent`, …) SHALL keep their host-derived values
- **AND** a render theme setting `surface` SHALL win over the dark preset
